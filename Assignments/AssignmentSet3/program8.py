# • Imports the Pay_Stub class from the pay_stub module.
# • Has a main function that
# o With appropriate prompts, gets the employee’s name, hours worked (float), and pay rate (float) as user
# input, and assigns the values to variables.
# o Creates/instantiates a pay_stub object.
# o Prints the pay_stub object.
# o Calls the class method that returns summary information and prints the result.
# • Calls the main function three times to verify that the summary information is correct.
