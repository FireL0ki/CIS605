# Create another module (program6.py) that
# • Imports the walk module.
# • Using appropriate prompts, gets the walker’s name, number of steps (int), and length of step in inches (int)
# as user input, and assigns the values to variables.
# • Creates/instantiates a walker object, calls the instance method that calculates the miles walked, and prints
# the result with appropriate wording and formatting (e.g., Beth Walker's walk with 9,876 steps averaging 30
# inches per step equates to 4.68 miles.).
